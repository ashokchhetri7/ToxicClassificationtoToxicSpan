# ToxicClassificationtoToxicSpan

### We are trying to make a model that can detect the span of toxicity not just classify whole post/comments are toxic.
### Given the binary toxic classification dataset we want to train the model by this, and get the toxicity detecting final trained model.

### Find the hugging face model that predicts only non-toxic tokens: https://huggingface.co/Ashokajou51/NonToxicCivilBert
